# ANSIBLE-REFACTORING-AND-STATIC-ASSIGNMENTS-IMPORTS-AND-ROLES-t

**The Objective of the Project**


*The objective of this project is to improve the Ansible code by refactoring it and creating assignments, and to learn how to use the imports functionality to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook. Refactoring involves making changes to the source code to enhance its readability, maintainability, extensibility, and reduce complexity without changing the expected behavior of the software. The main goal is to organize tasks and reuse them when needed while keeping the infrastructure state the same.*
